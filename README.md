# JavaProject
A java project that is supposed to simulate a nonprofit organization structure.

This project was done in my 1st year at CEID(Computer Engineering and Informatics Department) where me and my team got a project grade of 10/10. Each one of us had to communicate effectively to synchronize our work between classes that had to be created for the project
to work efficiently.

The whole project was done in IntelliJ IDEA.
